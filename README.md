# Library-book-status-tool

This is a small web application which is used to search the status of a book in a Library.

Features 

The category of the book is to be selected from the list in the drop down(which consists of all thecategories in the Library e.g: fiction, java, etc..) 
Then we need to press an HTML output or a Excel output 

Which gives the result as a HTML outpu if we select the former one and Excel output if we select the Latter one 

so an excel output gives the Full list of the books under that category and 
An HTM output gives the full list of books in that category where further dynamic webpages can be accessed like, we can select the book and see 
the entire/full details of the book

Where as an excel output will disply the same info in an excel sheet.
